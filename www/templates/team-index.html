        <p>Originally I wanted to use something with the stats from players from each team and make DataVis with D3.</p>

        <p>I built the module for D3, you can see it in /lib/js/d3.js</p>

        <p>It turned out the API wasn't as smart as I wanted and I did not have access to a roster based on a team without paying for the upgraded API :(</p>

        <p>So I just built a simple directive that takes in a teams data and displays their color and the team name. The offset for the API is randomly generated with each API call. Enjoy.</p>
